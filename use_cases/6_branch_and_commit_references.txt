----------------------------------------------Branch_and_Commit_References.txt-----------------------------------------------------


1. `<HEAD>`
    --> Pointer pointing to the latest commit in the recently switched/checked-out branch.


2. `<Detached HEAD>`
    --> When you check out a commit rather than a branch. It automatically points to that commit instead of a branch. Changes made in this state won't belong to any branch until you create a new branch or check out an existing branch.


3. `<BASE>`
    --> Common ancestor from which source and target branch originate. Used in merging, automatic merging, merging conflicts, and manual merging.


4. `<Relative refs>`
    - `<git checkout {HEAD^/HEAD~(num)}>`
    --> Move from parent commit to any commits before them.


5. `<git branch -f {specified_branch} {HEAD~(num)}>`
    --> Moves (by force) the specified branch to the num parents behind HEAD.
